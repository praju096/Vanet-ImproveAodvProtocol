Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) represent a special class of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) where vehicles act as mobile nodes that can communicate with each other without relying on a fixed infrastructure. VANETs are designed to support a wide range of applications including safety, traffic management, and infotainment services. Due to the highly dynamic nature of vehicle movement, VANETs face significant challenges such as frequent topology changes, high node mobility, and unstable links.

Routing in VANETs is critical because the communication paths between vehicles must be established quickly and maintained reliably despite rapid movement. Traditional MANET routing protocols, when directly applied to VANETs, often suffer from performance degradation. One such protocol is the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol, which is reactive and establishes routes only when needed. Although AODV reduces control overhead compared to proactive approaches, it struggles with maintaining reliable routes in highly mobile vehicular environments.

This project focuses on improving the reliability of the AODV protocol by dynamically tuning the route lifetime based on real-time network conditions. By enhancing route stability, we aim to increase the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and reduce routing overhead, making AODV more suitable for VANET applications
